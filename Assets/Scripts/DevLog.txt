Problem: 
V   Forward is Camera Forward NOT A PROBLEM FOR NOW
V   Vignette lower A LOT DONE
V   Jump automatically when maxed
V   Decrease shake effect

V    Bounce has to be dependent of the position of the wall  
V    Terminate first bounce without reason
V    Maybe lower the inverse y force when hitting his head
V    Sometimes inverse y force doesn't work as expected
Optimize code (remove coroutines somehow)

Ideas:
V  Never ending corridor with the breakfast in the end
running breakfast
